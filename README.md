The goal of this project is to predict the probabilities of customers defaulting in their next months payments using their historical transaction data. Therefore, the problem is defined as supervised imbalanced classification, where the majority class (as it is shown in section 3) are the normal non defaulting customers and the minority class are the defaulters.
